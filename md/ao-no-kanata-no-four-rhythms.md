# Summary: Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms

## Episode 1 - Teach Me How To Fly

The game opens on a short scene between a sad young girl who needs to go and a young boy who tries to cheer her up by giving him something precious to him. The boy promises the girl that if she holds it and makes a wish to the sky, he'll come flying right away to save her.
The boy is the main character, **Masaya Hinata**, who used to believe everything was within his reach as a kid, thanks to the *Anti-Gravitation Shoes* he acquired in the summer of his third year of elementary school. However, something happened that left him with a deep trauma and took away his love for the sky.

**"And so I turned my back on the sky."**

The game truly starts as Masaya is running late to school for the beginning of his sophomore year of high school. He runs into **Asuka Kurashina** as she was looking for the key to her house that she had dropped. He helps her find it, then decides to fly to school with Asuka as they were running late and running wouldn't cut it. The school's P.E. teacher, **Aoi Kagami**, spots them as they land on the school's terminal.
They separate and Masaya goes to class where he meets his friend **Misaki Tobisawa**, famous for her low blood pressure (as in she speaks monotonously and seems disinterested), who asks him about the girl he arrived at school with, before their homeroom teacher Aoi enters the class. She tells Masaya to meet her after class to talk. As school is over, Misaki seems full of energy and totally different from her earlier attitude. They are joined by **Madoka Aoyagi**, the class representative. As Masaya leaves the room, he bumps into **Mashiro Arisaka**, a lower classmate who loves Misaki. He then goes to the faculty room to talk to Aoi, who asks him to teach the new student, Asuna, how to fly.
*Grav Shoes* are common in the city where they live, but they aren't in most other places. The city is essentially a testing ground for this new technology. As such, the limited area flight instructor system allows certified individuals to teach beginners how to fly, and Masaya happens to be one of them.
Asuka then meets Misaki and Mashiro, who both join her and Masaya for the flying lesson. Masaya explains that 15 years earlier, particles called anti-gravitons were discovered that allowed for the invention of *Anti-Gravitation Shoes*. Asuka then tries to fly for a bit, but has a lot of trouble keeping balance. After they go back home to the terminal they used the very same morning to rush to school, Masaya's attention gets caught by a girl gracefully flying back home.
Later that evening, Masaya notices someone moved in next door after the house had been left unoccupied for years. Their new neighbors ring at the door to introduce themselves, and it so happens that they are the girl that had caught his attention earlier, **Rika Ichinose**. After an awkward first interaction, the Hinatas eat the handmade soba noodles Rika brought as a gift. When he goes back upstairs to his room, Masaya looks out his window and sees Rika in her underwear, changing herself. *(insert ecchi anime comedy moment)*
The next day, Asuka officially joins the class. After class, Masaya quizzes Asuka during their flight lesson, when Mashiro joins them and starts quizzing them about Misaki, who then joins them as well. Later, Asuka loses control and almost bumps into someone, who happens to be Rika. Her and Masaya have a misunderstanding regarding his relation with Asuka, Rika believing they are a couple and getting frustrated by him not apologizing about the situation from last night but about her "girlfriend" almost bumping into her.
The next day, Asuka and Masaya go out on a long-distance trip around **Kunahama Island**, one of the island that make up **Shitou City**. While taking a break on a beach, Asuka talks about her past and how she used to be shy and introverted until another kid her age appeared and offered her to play together. Asuka didn't open her heart to her, so the girl told her: **"If you just make yourself believe you're having fun, then you'll find everything in the world fun. If you've been secluding yourself this whole time, then there's twice as much fun waiting for you out in the world."** And Asuka has been living by these words ever since. She asks Masaya why he decided to teach her how to fly, to which he responds that it's because Ms. Kagami asked him to.
Asuka then mentions how a sport using Grav Shoes would be really fun, reviving Masaya's trauma. He brushes it off, remembering his conversation with Aoi where she let him know that, despite not forcing him, she wants him to fly again and won't give up on his talent.
As they were about to head back, they overhear what sounds like a fight between two people. It is actually the result of *Flying Circus* match between **Reiko Satouin** and **Shion Aoyagi** , where Satouin stole away his right to use the "in" in "Kunahama Gakuin" (or "academic stitute" in the ENG translation). Asuka jumps in and challenges Satouin to get the "in" suffix back. As a complete beginner, Satouin has to teach her the rules: matches are conducted in a 300 meter square that's formed over the sea using buoys. They are one versus one, and the player who collects the most points within ten minutes wins. The two ways of scoring are either to touch your opponent's back or to touch for buoys in order.
During their battle, thanks to Masaya's guidance using a pair of earphones and a stroke of luck, Asuka manages to score a point by performing an *Airkick Turn* and earn back the "in" suffix.
After the match, Shion asks them to join the Flying Circus club at their school. Masaya reminisces about the time when he would train to fly faster with Aoi.
The next day, Masaya is greeted by Shion begging him to join the FC club. He discovers he is Madoka's big brother. After class, Masaya plainly refuses Shion's offer and goes home, where he opens a drawer and takes out a dusty box containing his old FC Shoes from back when he was a kid. He decides to turn Shion down flat the next day.
On Friday, the next day, Shion misinterprets his refusal for a challenge to show his determination. The following week, he keeps coming back and begging him to join every day.
The following Monday marks the last day of Asuka's flying lessons. She asks him if he truly doesn't intend on joining the club. but Masaya refuses once again. Then on the next day, she announces that she will be joining the FC club. She is joined by Misaka and Mashiro, as well as Madoka as a manager. The next day, even Aoi announces that she is becoming the club advisor for the FC club, prompting Masaya to go talk to her after class. They talk as the FC club's first activities take place, and Aoi invites Masaya to teach them what she taught him, as a coach if not as a player. When he leaves the room, Masaya is faced with a determined Asuka who asks him to teach her Flying Circus. Masaya asks why she wants him specifically to teach her, to which she responds that it is because he is the one who showed her how fun flying was. Those words open the door to his memories, back when he himself asked Aoi to teach him Flying Circus because she was the one who showed him how fun flying was. This memory makes him realize even though his dream ended up getting shattered, he can't keep others from enjoying the fun of it for selfish reasons. Masaya accepts to become Asuka's coach. Aoi watches them dash to the courtyard to join the other members of the FC club.

## Episode 2 - Circus In The Sky

Masaya joins the other members, and Misaki and Mashiro tease him. Masaya decides to assume both the roles of coach and second. He explains that a second is the player giving indications to the Skywalker, informing them of their opponent's location for example. He also decides to call everyone by their first names in order to create a sense of familiarity between players and Skywalkers, except for Shion who he will still call Prez.
In order to establish personalized training routines for each player, Masaya asks if anyone has any experience playing FC. Misaki replies that she has, and picks Fighter as her favorite play style. Masaya explains the three play styles are Fighter, All-Rounder and Speeder. Fighters try to touch their opponents' back to score points, while Speeders try to avoid their opponents by racing between the four buoys. All-Rounders go for both.
In order to explain the rules to Asuka, Masaya has Shion and Misaki face off in a practice match. They first show how a Speeder wins, then how a Fighter does. Masaya explains the different ways they can score points and win, while Misaki is bullying Prez. 

> *Also Misaki's activation key being 飛ぶニャン was so damn funny!!*

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/Aokana_GtD2APmSQM.jpg" /> 

Onto the topic of the clubroom, Shion explains that getting one will be impossible as all of them have already been taken by other clubs by now. Misaki mentions seeing something on the cliff while coming back from the practice match, which turns out to be an old, abandoned bus. They decide to make it their clubroom and start cleaning it. As they're done and about to leave, Mashiro asks about whether men and women play together in the same category, to which Masaya replies that they do. This leads to a comical exchange about trying to touch Mashiro's breasts during a match. Anyway, Masaya explains that it's impossible due to the energy fields created by the shoes repelling each other, then also explains that while it's possible to make the Anti-Gravitation devices smaller, it is impossible to make it bigger, which is why there are no flying cars. The shoes have a max weight limit of 300kg. They then wrap up the day.
The next day, Aoi calls out Asuka to show her a special video, one of Masaya playing FC back when he was younger.
Another day, Masaya is on his way to a store to buy Grav Shoes with his friends. He calls out to a girl sweeping in front of the store, **Minamo**, the little sister of the store manager. They then enter the store, "Shirase Sky Sports". They meet **Shirase**, the store manager, who gives an explanation of the different types of shoes. Grav Shoes emit anti-gravitons that form a layer around the body, called a "membrane". Making different parts thicker or thinner allows gravity to pull you forward. The way this membrane is tuned differs between the different types of shoes: Speeder shoes are thinner at the top to allow for higher speeds, while Fighter ones are high sensitivity all over, allowing players to move in quick bursts at the cost of a lower speed. Balancers allow to fine tune the way the membrane reacts, making it possible for it to be sensitive only on one side of the body for example, allowing for quick movements only when moving to the right.

> *Holy, that one line when Misaki tries on the Laevateinns Grav Shoes is so damn funny lmao*

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/Aokana_qc5EmvCU2o.jpg" /> 

In the end, Misaki goes for Invade's Leaveteinns, Mashiro gets the Siamese from Small Grove and Asuka follows Masaya's advice to pick the Hien type 4, an updated model of his original Hien type 1. To Asuka's request, they then go back to school to try out their new shoes. With the help of Misaki, Masaya shows Asuka how it feels to touch someone's back and score a point. Misaki then tells Mashiro to do a loop, which she fails miserably and spins down out of control, leading to a comical interaction between her trying to hide her panties and Masaya telling her to spread her arms and legs to regain control of her balance.
Later that day, back at home, Masaya's internet doesn't work. It leads to him fixing internet on Rika's pc, which had been using his own router's connection up until now.
The next day, as he arrives at the clubroom, Masaya finds the girls changing themselves in the bus and decides to peep at them.


> *Freaking degenerate weirdo, the cringe is barely bearable...*

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/Aokana_cJi3la619k.jpg" /> 

After that... incident, they decide on their goal: aiming to reach top 8 in the prefectural tournament! But first come the basics. They all spent the day training over the sea, trying to fly in a straight line then to touch each others' back. As they were about to call it a day, Aoi joins them to inform the club that she has scheduled a training camp as well as practice matches with Takafuji academy over the Golden Week. Masaya spends the evening lost in thoughts, wondering how he will get the team to the level it needs to reach to perform during matches. He reassures Asuka that she isn't forcing this role onto him and that he's into this for the long haul. She promises herself that she can become better, as she caresses her hairpin, which she describes as her lucky charm.

## Episode 3 - Rivals

Fast forward to the Golden Week. Guided by Aoi, they all head to the training camp in Takafuji Academy. Aoi explains that it has an Administrative Council instead of a Student Council, which practically runs the school, giving the students a lot of power. It's also a huge school, the main branch being located on the mainland.

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/Aokana_WqAfEQNyuh.jpg" /> 

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/Aokana_ArNc6YaVpi.jpg" /> 

Aoi and Masaya discuss why they're flying to their destination instead of using other means of transport, and she gives a few different reasons including being short on time, no funds and wanting to see how her student's apprentices were doing after a week of training. Asuka butts in to ask about the school they're heading to, as Aoi forgot to continue her explanation. After Madoka interrupting them again, Masaya flies off to the side and decides to continue Aoi's explanation to Asuka in her stead, when they suddenly arrive at the school, located on Fukuru Island, 5.4km south-west of Kunahama Island, 90 min away by ferry.
They discuss their reasons for not attending this school.

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/Aokana_iz1nWBMhwp.jpg" /> 

As they expand on the whole "Administrative Council" thing, the school's FC club arrives, spearheaded by Satouin. Rika is also part of the group. The club's leader, **Kazunari Shoudou**, known as the strongest Skywalker of this generation, is absent on urgent business.
Aoi's introduction leads to many fangirls screaming, as she used to be pretty famous among girls. After Masaya's introduction, she gives him a ton of credit, raising everyone's expectations for him, and announces she's leaving everything in his hands as she will be going back until the end of the training camp.

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/Aokana_z7hGfucGgr.jpg" /> 

Masaya puts the spotlight on Shion, who was feeling down after Aoi made Masaya sound like the club leader, cheering him up by complimenting his muscles and leadership. Everyone then introduce themselves.

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/Aokana_CWrC8pYmDG.jpg" /> 

After the introductions are over, the girls go to change, leaving Masaya alone. Rika then approaches him and leads him away from the other students to talk. She asks him why they chose to do that training camp now, a mere two months away from the summer tournament, which will be the last one for all the seniors, just to train a club that just formed. As Masaya is thinking of a reply to give, they get interrupted by Shindou. He suddenly reveals Masaya's past as a legendary Skywalker. As Rika wasn't aware, he asks why she was pulling him away then. They come up with a cover up explanation of her asking for his autograph, forcing him to sign her treasured handkerchief, before just telling him the truth as he was pointing an inconsistency. After that, Shindou reveals the training camp is actually happening with the consent of both schools as he just wanted an excuse to meet Masaya. Although that may have been a lie, as he brushes off the question when Masaya asks how long he had been listening in.

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/Aokana_RNTMQjF0DN.jpg" /> 

They then get back, and the girls, who are done changing, join Masaya. The group heads to Takafuji's practice ground, at the beach. Masaya and Shindou decide on the schedule for their training session, and Shindou asks Satou to start the training while they are discussing. After a funny interaction, Satouin reveals her name is actually Reiko Satou, as per her birth certificate. But for some reason, she just likes the "in" part and fights for it.
After the practice, Masaya massages Shion when Shindou joins them and shares his plan to peep on the girls with them.

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/Aokana_49EW3frHNq.png" /> 

As they were about to plan their strategy, Madoka calls Masaya, asking him where they are. She was about to enter the bath and had a bad feeling. They hang up, except Madoka actually forgets and Masaya decides to listen in. After mundane talk, Satouin joins them and offers to service them. The 2nd and 3rd year all run away, leaving only our 5 heroines and the Takafuji freshmen. The senior relate their past experience, with Satouin washing their body using her bare hands then soaping up her body... Suddenly. Masaya snaps back to reality as Shindou calls for him, and ends the call. As for the peeping, it had been cancelled as Shion was getting too into the idea.
During the night, Masaya gets up, goes outside, and starts flying. Rika notices him.
The second day of the training camp, each player type gets split into different groups. Masaya goes around checking each group. **Hosaka Minori** explains over 60% of Takafuji's Skywalkers are Fighters because it's essentially the meta since Speeders can't outrun them forever. The girl is a freshman at Kunahama who is in Mashiro's class and showed up out of the blue that morning in order to cover this training camp for the Broadcasting Club. Anyway, Masaya wants the girls to practice the Scissors, a maneuver that consists in doing short, quick turns in order to avoid your attacker while still going forward, and hopefully getting in their back. In order to learn, Masaya has them slalom between buoys spaced 3m away in both axis. Misaki performs flawlessly and with ease, seemingly putting no effort into it, while Mashiro struggles. Masaya calls Mashiro to suggest her to switch her playstyle to Speeder as it would suit her better, but decides against it halfway through. Instead, {**CHOICE**} he asks about Misaki's lack of motivation, improving Mashiro's opinion of him as he looks like a real coach. Minori then snaps a surprise picture of the two.
After the Fighters, it's time for the All-Rounders. After practice, Minori snaps another picture of the group, then she joins Masaya as they head for the Speeders. They meet Shindou, who Masaya is switching place with. Minori speaks very politely with him, despite speaking casually all day long, especially with Masaya. After their exchange, Minori also reveals Shindou asked her to take as many pictures of him. Anyway, they are interrupted by Rika asking for the training to be started.
Masaya chooses the Low Yo-Yo as their practice for the day, a move using the earth's gravity pull to gain speed before climbing back up at high speed. The High Yo-Yo is the opposing move, going for a high arc in order to let your opponent overshoot and get in their back. Masaya then calls Rika to talk to her, but she has trouble focusing because of their last conversation. Minori then butts in, asking for an interview as a way to ease the atmosphere. After she asks a little too much to Rika, Masaya stops the interview, putting the spotlight on him ; Minori then mentions a hidden star player in Kunohama, unknowingly spilling more info about his past as she doesn't realize it is him. Rika ends up helping him keep the secret from Minori and returns to practice.
Afterwards, they all eat together food prepared by the girls. Delighted by the meat cooked by Rika, Asuka decides to go thank her. Masaya (**CHOICE**) decides to tag along/ or not.
At night, Masaya has trouble falling asleep and decides to go out again. He spots Rika, who asks him what he is doing. He uses his job as a coach as an excuse, saying he's been fiddling around with Grav Shoes to get hands-on experience. To their mutual surprise, they both apologize at the same time: Masaya, for going off by himself during the training camp ; Rika, for calling him a peeping tom during the incident the day she moved in. And she also apologizes for what she said the day before, regarding the Kunohama FC club. Aaand also for looking up his name and finding out about his past. Rika offers her help to Masaya, if it's something he can't handle on his own, before backing down as she realizes he has a girlfriend to fill that role... Masaya finally dismisses the misunderstanding regarding Asuka. Finally, Rika apologizes for one more thing, venting about the training camp on her blog, but explains she corrected her mistake in another post. She then somehow falls as she tries to grab her phone after Masaya catches a glimpse of her user handle, Rikarika, and then... ecchi situation.
Afterwards, Masaya gets back to sleep. As he's about to slumber, he feels someone slipping into his futon. It's Shindou, who asks to have a talk with him. He asks to have a match with him, right now. Masaya sort of refuses, as Shindou figured. However, he also asks why he returned to FC after all these years, and whether he would fight him if he beat the girls who motivated him to return. Seeing Masaya's reaction, he apologizes and leaves his futon.
The final day of the training camp, practice matches are organized. The order is Misaki, Mashiro, Asuka and then Shion. Shindou self-nominates himself to face Misaki.
The match starts one-sided, with Shindou overwhelming Misaki in both speed and technique, but thanks to Saitouin's advice to Masaya, he's able to give instructions to Misaki that help her fight him in a dogfight and score two points, to everyone's surprise.
After that, skipping Mashiro's match, it's time for Asuka's. She is against Rika. During the match, Rika keeps throwing Asuka off with techniques effective against beginners, but Asuka gradually learns how to regain her balance mid-air. Then, as she had overshot Rika and was about to get her back touched, she manages to pull an Airkick Turn, get behind Rika and score a point.
This marks the end of the three day training camp. Shindou asks Masaya to apologize on his behalf to Misaki, and is expecting great things from both her and Asuka.

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/Aokana_wh78w40iU0.png" /> 

The two shake hands, and it's time for Rika's farewells... except Satouin jumps first, to thank him for the training camp. It's finally Ichinose's turn, and they repeat last night's situation by both apologizing at the same time, except Rika says thank you while Masaya says sorry. They set the record straight regarding what happened the night before, and end up easing their relationship.
Both school clubs bow to each other and part ways, marking the end of the training camp.
Aoi escorts them back home, and asks how things went. Asuka asks Masaya if he can train her when they get back home, and manages to convince Misaki and Mashiro too.

{KOTOKO - Infinite Sky}

New characters get introduced.

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/Aokana_PJQyQTX33t.jpg" /> 

## Episode 4 - I Want To Fight Too

As everyone is gathered before practice, Madoka gives Masaya summarized data on all members. After some chatter and banter, they have a meeting. As midterms are approaching, club activities will have to be suspended 3 days prior to the date of the exams. Aoi explains that if you fail them and then the make-up exams, you will be banned from club activities. Seeing the reactions of Mashiro and Asuka, he offers to form a study group. After getting on Mashiro's bad side, Masaya fails to bring up that he wants her to change playstyles.
Later, during practice, Mashiro injures her foot when landing. Madoka inspects it, but it doesn't seem to be anything too serious.

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/IMG-202403201649-Aokana_lywmbCNaPg.jpg" /> 

As Madoka and Mashiro leave to the hospital, Masaya shares with the others his concerns that Mashiro might hate her. Misaki then decides to leave, probably to go check on Mashiro. Masaya (CHOICE) decides to let her go and the three members left resume practice.
After practice, Masaya surprises Misaki as she was practicing flying on her own, fighting against an imaginary opponent. After explaining why he showed up out of the blue, Masaya bows and asks her to help him befriend Mashiro. Misaki says they should just keep talking until they get along, as trust is something you build over time. However, with the promise of free udon, she does accept to pull out her last resort. After stopping by a convenience store to buy pudding, she brings Masaya to an udon place where they meet **Botan**, then go upstairs. Masaya unknowingly enters what happens to be Mashiro's room. He hurriedly leaves before she finds out. He stops by to apologize to Botan, who reveals she's actually Mashiro's mother (he thought she was her sister). Mashiro then arrives. Mashiro asks to talk with Masaya, prompting Misaki to leave. Mashiro appears to actually be more shy than cold, and the two agree to try and get closer to each other. Mashiro gives Masaya her PSQ in order to use video games as a way to bring the two closer together.
Back at hone, Masaya finishes studying and pulls out the PSQ. He thinks back to their discussion.

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/IMG-202403201649-Aokana_E0dzAx0QSX.jpg" /> 

It makes him realizes he hasn't gotten absorbed into anything since back when he quit FC, including his job as a coach, and he decides to try and change that, using the PSQ as an opportunity to leave his comfort zone. As he goes to check a guide online, he notices a mail on his pc. After a few back-and-forth, Rika, the one he was conversing with, calls out to him through the window. They mention MonEat, and Rika says he should ask Mashiro for advice instead of her.
The next day, Masaya does just that. After class, everyone decide to play MonEat together in the club room, marking the start of day 1 of the "After Practice Gaming Club". The evening after day 2, Masaya coaches Rika to help her practice FC, to return the favor for what happened during the training camp. However, as the tournament is inching closer, he (CHOICE) decides to stop coaching her soon, as it would be detrimental to his own club's players.
Back home, he asks Rika about MonEat, but finds a strategy guide inside his bag with a sticky note featuring Doommeow.
A few days later, Mashiro is impressed at how good Masaya has become. As they're playing together, they start opening up a little bit more to each other.
Masaya keeps playing MonEat after that. As he's leaving the club room, he gets found out by Aoi, who was already aware of the situation thanks to Madoka. However, she also brings up midterms, which he had totally forgotten about.
The next day, it's decided that Misaki will tutor Asuka, Madoka will tutor Mashiro and Shion will have to study by himself as he is a year older. As for Mashiro, Madoka and Masaya go remind her to study. As she is still in class, they decide to take a peek to see how she is doing. They catch her wearing glasses, then return to class. Having learned she has bad eyesight, Masaya later goes to the clubroom. He plays MonEat with Mashiro and tells her he thought she looked cute with glasses after she asks about it.
After that, all scheduled practices were replaced with study sessions. One week later, it was time for midterms. The three days of exams resulted in everyone but Mashiro passing. However, she managed to pass her make-up exams, barely managing to remain in the FC club.
Finally, it was time for udon! Everyone shows up at Mashiro's place, and cheerfully eat while chatting. At some point, Mashiro pulls Masaya away to talk in private and ask about Misaki's motivation during practice. He reassures her on that aspect, and also asks Mashiro about whether she likes FC, to which she replies that Asuka is rubbing off on him.
As they're flying back home together, Masaya also asks Asuka if she likes FC, to which she proudly responds that she does. Her unbound optimism makes him as happy as scared, as he's worried she might turn out the same way he did. As her coach, as well as Misaki's and Mashiro's, he decides to do his best to guide them.
The next day, they all go to the orthopedic clinic with Mashiro to do a last check-up, and she announces that her foot is all healed. Tipped off by Madoka, Masaya reveals to Asuka that he knows she made a wish for Mashiro's recovery in exchange for sweets, using it as a way to lose weight at the same time.
That evening, as they are going back, Mashiro asks Masaya to keep his promise and play MonEat with her. After they arrive at the flying terminal, they are met by **Arika Okoze**, a freshman at Shitou Suisan Academy, who got the nickname Tanny because of Mashiro. She explains she saw two people she knows with their PSQ, and decided to join them. After playing for a while, they notice someone forgot a bag at the flying terminal. As Mashiro is about to take off to bring them, Okoze jumps ahead, grabbing the bag, and flies straight towards their owner with an immaculate form. As she goes back, she confirms Masaya and Mashiro's suspicions by announcing she joined her school's FC club. The two also tell her they're part of their school's FC club, but the group gets interrupted by the appearance of **Mayu Ganeko**, a sophomore at Shitou Suisan Academy. They take off after Arika calls Mayu "big sis".

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/IMG-202403201649-Aokana_DGTTlMrIM7.jpg" /> 

Afterwards, as Masaya is about to get home, Misaki appears and drags him to her house to carry the exercise ball she'd mentioned a while ago to their club room. They end up playing with the two exercises balls for a while in Misaki's room.
The next afternoon, during meeting, Masaya brings up changing Mashiro's playstyle. To his surprise, she immediately accepts. As everyone is cheerfully bantering, the Kunohama Academy FC Club is finally starting to feel like a real team.

## Episode 5 - Before The Storm

The rainy season has come to Shitou City, making it hard to impossible for the FC club to practice. Instead, Masaya has them practice regular stamina training at the gym. Asuka and Prez are bursting with energy, while Mashiro and Misaki feel bored and keep complaining.
A few days later, Masaya meets Aoi in the hallway after school. She sees right through him and tells him to let them have more fun. That evening, Masaya looks at old photo album and finds pictures of him during practice that he'd forgotten about. After calling Rika to ask for her opinion, he decides to switch up the program by having the girls play tag as practice. Mashiro first tries to catch Misaki, then it's Misaki's turn to catch Asuka. As Misaki is about to catch her, Asuka manages to do a backflip over her attacker and land behind her, much to everyone's surprise, including Asuka. In order to make the best use of her physical abilities, Masaya (CHOICE) decides to keep this at the back of his mind for now. They then wrap up practice for the day.
That Saturday, Masaya accompanies Asuka as she walks her dog, then treats her to a parfait. After leaving the café, they bump into Minamo, who quickly takes her leave after mistaking them for a couple. They then bump into Misaki, who joins them. They decide to hit up an arcade.

<img src="/md/\Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythms-attachments/IMG-202403201649-Aokana_KAVkiplDBa.png" /> 

Misaki and Masaya end up playing a dance rhythm game, then winning plushies at an UFO catcher.
After spending the day with them, Masaya goes shopping on his own. Except he ends up going out at the same time as Rika, and for the same destination. After doing the trip together, as they were about to part ways at the mall so as not to look suspicious, they are met by Saitouin who was there to check the advancement of renovations to the Skywall. They end up going shopping together, then eating fried chicken Rika bought.

Saitouin then leaves, shouting her unusual activation sequence: "Grant thy azure blessing to mine wings!". After that, Rika and Masaya fly home, having seemingly grown a bit closer. As Rika leaves, Minori appears and reveals she had been following them around since they first flew off. In exchange for overlooking it, she reveals Masaya that Kairyou Academy had apparently gotten their hand on a genius player, before running away.
A few days later, it's time for finals. Everyone managed to pass this time around, with Asuka showing incredible improvement compared to mid-terms, unlike Mashiro. The girls decide to do a girls' night, so Masaya flies back home. That's when he spots a girl with silver hair, who says he looks like someone she knows, before leaving,
The next day, it's time for practice to resume. Masaya asks the girl to bring their swimsuits, in order to practice at the beach.

Masaya invites Shirase to teach them about accident prevention.

He explains that everyone who does sky sports has to attend a mandatory yearly safety course. It's a relic from back when Grav Shoes weren't as safe and could fail mid-air, but it never lead to any fatal injuries as each shoe is the other's fail-safe system, since the output remains the same regardless of whether you have one or two of them. That's why Shirase has them practice falling into the ocean, by deactivating their shoes 2m above it. He has a permit that allows him to get unlock codes from the government, allowing to bypass the mechanism that prevents people from deactivating Grav Shoes mid-flight. He also explains they need to fall feet first, clench their butt and protect their crotch.
They then practice falling. First Prez, then Mashiro, Misaki, and Asuka.

Then, it's water gun battle royale time.

After that, they spent their days practicing for the upcoming tournament, that was now a week away. After some round robins practice matches with Aoi and Masaya as seconds, Asuka wants to push herself and practice even more. As she might become a top Skywalker if she keeps it up, Masaya (CHOICE) decides to tell her about it to keep her motivated. He and Masaya also give advice to help the club members improve.

Cutting to Shindou and Satouin, the latter recites the bit of "knowledge" about the origin of seaweed soup she learnt from Masaya. Shindou plainly tells her it's a load of nonsense, and Satouin vows to make Masaya pay for tricking her.
## Episode 6 - The Grand Finals And Aftermath

It's finally time for the tournament. Aoi tells them to make sure not to get a heatstroke, as it can get you disqualified.

Minori appears as they mention the word "journalist", and reveals the match will be broadcasted live on a local TV station, and also that she will be live commentating the final match.
After that, they go check the brackets, and Mashiro finds herself facing against Satouin. Even worse, Misaki will be facing Rika, then Shindou if she wins. As for Asuka, her first opponent will be a freshman from Kairyou Academy. However, in the third round, she will have to face Misaki, Ichinose or Shindou. Lastly, Shion will face a sophomore from Kairyou. As Masaya is about to give a speech to his team, a mysterious player makes his appearance.

Shirase also shows up, seemingly knowing but hiding something about that mysterious player. He explains he's there to sell souvenirs like T-shirts, towels and beginner Grav Shoe kits at a stall. Masaya asks him to come watch their matches so he can give him advice on how to coach the girls. Arika shows up just after Shirase leaves, declaring war against Mashiro. She's soon joined by Mayu, who "scolds" her for being impolite towards Misaki.

> *holy say gex wtf is happening between those two*

After they leave, Madoka remembers her name and reveals Mayu is actually a very good player, even considered to be the main competition to Shindou.
After a short speech by the tournament chair and a few fireworks, the tournament is finally starting. It's supposed to have a grand total of 64 matches, spread out over two days.
Masaya has a strategy meeting with Shion before his match. He's then approached by Irina, probably Shion's opponent's second. She asks for them to go easy on her player, Saki Inui, as it's her first match in Japan.
The match ends up being a battle of Speeders. Saki, with her beautiful form, stays ahead of Shion all along, but he manages to out speed her at the very end of the match, ending with a score of 20:1. His last burst of speed awards him a thunderous applause from the audience.
After the match, as the girls are talking about Prez's performance, they get interrupted by the crowd's cheers. The masked skywalker, a player from Kamidorisha Academy is about to compete. Their name: "Mysterious Masked Skywalker". They ended up being pretty average, and even losing their match 4:5, leaving everyone confused.
Soon, it's time for Mashiro's match.
